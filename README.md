This site is themed around a family friend's business and I might give it to them because they don't have a site.

This site is made to be a development sandbox. On this page, I'm attempting to develop best practice skills, REACT development (on-and-off), LESS best practices as well as various styling techniques that we don't typically employ on our sites. 

This will also be a testing ground for various styles of mobile development. There is some fun discussion of getting away from the "hamburger" menu.
